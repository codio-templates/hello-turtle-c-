## Strings
A string is a collection of text, numbers, or symbols. Strings are always surrounded by quotation marks. Copy the code below and `TRY IT`.

```c++
string words = "This is a string.";
cout << words << endl;
```

{Try it}(sh .guides/bg.sh g++ code/fundamentals/string.cpp -o code/fundamentals/string ./code/fundamentals/string 1)

## What happens if you:
* Forget one of the `"` quotation marks?
* Forget both `"` `"` quotation marks?
* Use single (`'`) quotation marks?
* Use uppercase `String` instead of lowercase `string`?

{Try it}(sh .guides/bg.sh g++ code/fundamentals/string.cpp -o code/fundamentals/string ./code/fundamentals/string 2)

Notice that when you print a string, the quotation marks are not printed.
