Write a program that divides `7` by `2` and prints out the result (`3.5`) **without** using the `printf()` command. Your program **must** do the following things:

1. Declare **two** variables and assign them to the appropriate values, and **use** them to calculate your quotient of `3.5`.
2. Include just **one** division (`/`) operator in your code.
3. Use just **one** `cout <<` statement.
