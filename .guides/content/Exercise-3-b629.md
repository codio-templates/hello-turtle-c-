To test the code, first compile and then check the output of a few different test cases:

To test your code, first `COMPILE` it and then check the output of a few different test cases below:

{Compile}(g++ code/fundamentals/exercise3.cpp -o code/fundamentals/exercise3)
{Test 1}(sh .guides/secure/fundamentals/exercise3.sh Welcome Goodbye)
{Test 2}(sh .guides/secure/fundamentals/exercise3.sh Howdy Sayonara)
