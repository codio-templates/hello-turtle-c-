* ### Identify some functions that can be used with lists of numbers
* ### Describe what happens when these functions are used with strings

## Assumptions
Students will be working with lists of numbers. Though `min` and `max` can work with other data types, `sum` cannot.

## Limitations
List iteration has not yet been introduced. It is not yet possible to code a "proof" of some of these functions.
