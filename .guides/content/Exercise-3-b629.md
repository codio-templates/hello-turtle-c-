Write a program that:

 1. Prints the value of `line1`.
 1. On a new line, prints the value of `line2`.
 1. Make sure there is a new line after `line2`.
 
To test the code, first compile and then check the output of a few different test cases:

{Compile}(javac code/fundamentals/Exercise3.java)
{Test 1}(java -cp code/fundamentals/ Exercise3 Welcome Goodbye)
{Test 2}(java -cp code/fundamentals/ Exercise3 Howdy Sayonara )
