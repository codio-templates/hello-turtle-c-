## List Repetition

You can use the repetition operator (`*`) to a list. This is similar to string repetition from the lesson on data types.

```python
list_1 = ["Hi!"]

print(list_1 * 4)
```

{try it}(python3 code/lists/list-repeat.py 1)

## What happens if you:
* Change the `print` statement to be `print(list_1 * 100)`?
* Change the `print` statement to be `print(list_1 * 0)`?
* Change the `print` statement to be `print(list_1 * -1)`?

<details><summary>**What does `[]` mean?**</summary>The `[]` is called an empty list. This is a list that has no elements. If you use the `*` operator and 0 or a negative integer on a list, it will produce an empty list.</details>
