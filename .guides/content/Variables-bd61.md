## What Is a Variable?
In computer science, we often need to use data. **Variables** are used to store a value for a particular type of data.

### Each variable in C++ has:
1. a data type
1. a name
1. a value

We will discuss each of these parts over the rest of this reading assignment.

## Three Actions for Variables
There are a few different actions taken involving variables:
1. **Declaring** - when you set or declare the *data type* and *name* of the variable. These two properties of a variable do *not* change.
1. **Assigning** - when you set the *value* of the variable. The value of a variable *can* change.
1. **Accessing** - when you retrieve the *value* of the variable by calling its *name*.

You *must* declare and assign a variable before you can access it.
