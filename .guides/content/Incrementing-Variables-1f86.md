## Incrementing Variables
Incrementing a variable means to change the value of a variable by a set amount. You will most often have a counting variable, which means you will increment by 1.

```java
int a = 0;
a = a + 1;
System.out.print(a);
```

## How to Read `a = a + 1`
The variable `a` appears twice on the same line of code. But each instance of `a` refers to something different.

## The `++` and `+=` Operators
Incrementing is a common task for programmers. Many programming languages have developed a shorthand for `a = a + 1` because of this, `a++` does the same thing as `a = a + 1`.

```java
int a = 0;
int b = 0;
a = a + 1;
b++;
System.out.println(a);
System.out.println(b);
```

In the cases you need to increment by a different number, you can specify it using the `+=` operator. You can replace `b++;` with `b+=1;` in the above code and get the same result.

## What happens if you:
* Change `b` such that `b+=2`?
* Change `b` such that `b+=-1`?
* Change `b` such that `b-=1`?
