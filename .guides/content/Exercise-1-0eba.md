## Follow the Turtle

Imagine that you have a Turtle object called `tina`. You want `tina` to move around on a screen and leave a trail that draws a triangle like below.

Using a `for` loop, direct `tina` to follow the **exact** same path as above. Your code **must** include the following in order for you to receive credit for your work.

### Requirements:
* `tina` must move exactly as shown in the graphic above.
* You must include a `for` loop.
* You must declare an iterating variable `i` and initialize it to **zero** (e.g. `int i = 0`).
* Your loop **header** must include `i++`. In other words, `i` gets incremented by `1` after each iteration.
* Each edge or line of the triangle that `tina` creates must be exactly **100 pixels**.
* Each angle of the triangle must be exactly **60 degrees** .

**Hint:** The angle turned by `tina` and the angle of the triangle are supplementary to each other. **Supplementary** angles add up to **180 degrees**.
