* ### Recognize the symbols for arithmetic operators
* ### Use the `printf()` command to print doubles and integers
* ### Demonstrate how to increment and decrement a variable
* ### Perform string concatenation
* ### Apply PEMDAS rules to arithmetic operations

## Assumptions
* Students are comfortable with declaring variables and using the `cout` and `endl` commands.
* The only real explanation of the operation itself will be for modulo. Students are assumed to be familiar with the rest of these operators.

## Limitations
* The usefulness of modulo is not demonstrated as conditionals have not yet been introduced.
* `pow(a,b)` and `sqrt(a)` are introduced briefly. Students are not asked to do any physical importing because the header of the program they will be working with already contains the necessary library.
