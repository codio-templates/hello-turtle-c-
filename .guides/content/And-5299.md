## The `&&` Operator

The `&&` (and) operator allows for compound (more than one) boolean expressions. **All** boolean expressions **must** be true in order for the whole thing to be true. If at least **one** boolean expressions is false, then the whole thing is false.

```c++
bool a = true;
bool b = true;
bool c = false;
cout << boolalpha << (a && b) << endl;
```

## What happens if you:
* Replace `(a && b)` in the code above with `(a && c)`?
* Replace `(a && b)` in the code above with `(b && c)`?

## Multiple `&&` Statements

You can chain several `&&` expressions together. They are evaluated in a left-to-right manner.

```c++
bool a = true;
bool b = true;
bool c = false;
cout << boolalpha << (a && b && c) << endl;
```

## What happens if you:
* Replace `(a && b && c)` in the code above with `(a && b && a && b && a)`?
* Replace `(a && b && c)` in the code above with `(a && b && a && b && c)`?

<details><summary>**Hint(s)**</summary>`c` is the only variable is that is `false`. Thus, if c is involved in an `&&` expression, the entire thing will evaluate to `false`. Any combinations of `a`s and/or `b`s will result in `true`.</details>
