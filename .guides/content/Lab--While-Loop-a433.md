## Tutorial Lab 2: The while loop
Use the text editor open in the left pane, and enter the following code:

```python
counter = 0
while(counter < 10):
    print(counter)
    counter = counter + 1
print('while loop ended')
```

1) This loop will run as long as `counter` is less than 10.
2) Each time the loop runs, the value of `counter` is printed to the screen.
3) The value of `counter` is also incremented by 1.
4) At the end, a statement is printed to the screen, indicating the while loop has ended.
5) Recall that the while loop must have an exit condition. By incrementing the `counter` variable, we ensure that the loop will eventually end. If you do not increment `counter` in this loop, you will create an endless loop because `counter` will never reach 10 or greater.
