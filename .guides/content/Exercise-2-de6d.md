## Lists Exercise 2

**Problem**
Write a program that takes a list called `my_list` (it could be a list of any data type) and prints the list three times if the length of the list is less than 5. If the length of `my_list` is greater than or equal to 5, then print the list one time.

**Expected Output**
* If `my_list = ['hi', 'hello']` then you will print `['hi', 'hello', 'hi', 'hello', 'hi', 'hello']`
* If `my_list = [65, 111, 2, 81, 65, 32]` then you will print `[65, 111, 2, 81, 65, 32]`

**Important**
Do not edit the code in the top section. This code is necessary for the auto-grader to work. Add your code in the section below. Clicking the `TEST 1` button will test your code with `my_list = ['hi', 'hello']`. `TEST 2` will test your code with `my_list = [65, 111, 2, 81, 65, 32]`.
