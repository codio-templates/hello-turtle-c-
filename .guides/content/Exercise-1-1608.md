Write a program that:
 1. Declares a boolean variable called `my_bool`.
 1. Initializes it to the boolean value of `true`.
 1. Prints the value of `my_bool`.
 1. Re-assigns `my_bool` to the value of `test`.
 1. Prints the value of `my_bool`.

**Remember that the print value of `true` is `1` and the print value of `false` is `0`. You should NOT use `boolalpha <<` in your code!**
 
To test your code, first `COMPILE` it and then check the output of a few different test cases below:

{Compile}(g++ code/fundamentals/exercise1.cpp -o code/fundamentals/exercise1)
{Test with "true"}(sh code/fundamentals/exercise1.sh 1)
{Test with "false"}(sh code/fundamentals/exercise1.sh 0)

{Check It!|assessment}(code-output-compare-295500519)
