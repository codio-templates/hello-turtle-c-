* ### Identify which loops are used for list iteration
* ### Describe what happens when you iterate over a list?

## Assumptions
Students are familiar with lists and their indexes, for loops, the print statement, and modulo.

## Limitations
Students will learn that you can use a while loop to iterate over a list, but the for loop will be taught as the preferred way to do so.
