## Slicing a List
We are going to write a program that takes the middle third of a list and prints it. To keep things simple, we are going to work with list whose length is divisible by 3. The list will also be filled with random integers ranging from 0 to 100.

### Setup
Start by importing the `random` library. Then declare `numbers` as an empty list.

```python
import random

numbers = []
```

### Random Numbers
Use a for loop that repeats 9 times to append a random integer to `numbers`.

```python
for i in range(9):
    numbers.append(random.randint(0, 100))
```

### More Variables
We are going to need some more variables. First, we need to know how long the list is. So create a variable `length` and set it to `len(numbers)`. The `slice` operator requires two numbers, one is the starting position of the slice and the other is the stopping position of the slice. Create two variables, `start` and `stop`, and set their values to 0 for now. Finally, we will also need a list variable called `middle`. Set `middle` to the slice of `numbers` from `start` to `stop`.

```python
length = len(numbers)
start = 0
stop = 0
middle = numbers[start:stop]
```

### Calculating the Start and Stop Values
If you want to find the middle of a list of 9 numbers, divide the length (9) by 3, which is 3. So `numbers` is composed of three groups of three elements. That would mean that the middle third is the elements 4, 5, and 6. Another way to state this is that `start` is `length // 3 + 1` and `stop` is `length // 3 * 2`. However, this will not give the correct slice.

<details><summary>**Why use `//`?**</summary>The `slice` operator requires integers for its parameters. If you use the regular division (`/`), it will always return a floating point number. Floor division (`//`) will always return an integer. </details>

![Slice Example](.guides/images/slice-list-graphic.png)

Lists in Python start with the index 0. So calculating `start` with `length // 3 + 1` is off by 1. Change the declaration of `start` to be `length // 3`. The `slice` operator does not include the second parameter. So `stop` is not off by 1 like `start`. Change `stop` to be `length // 3 * 2`.

```python
start = length // 3
stop = length // 3 * 2
```

### Printing the Answer and Checking our Work
All of the calculations should be done. To check our work, start by printing the list `numbers`. Then print the value of `middle`. You should be able to check that `middle` actually is the middle third of `numbers`.

```python
print(numbers)
print("The middle is ", middle)
```
