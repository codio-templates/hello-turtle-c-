## Division

Division in Python is done with the `/` operator

```c++
double a = 25;
double b = 4;
System.out.println(a / b);
```

## What happens if you:
* Change `b` to `0`?
* Change `b` to `0.5`?
* Change the code to
```c++
double a = 25;
double b = 4;
a /= b;
System.out.println(a);
```

## Integer Division

Normally, you use `double` in Java division since the result usually involves decimals. If you use integers, the division operator returns an `int`. This "integer division" does not round up, nor round down. It removes the decimal value from the answer.
