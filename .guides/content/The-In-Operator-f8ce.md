## The In Operator

The `in` operator tells you if a value is present in a list. `in` is a boolean operator, so it will return `True` or `False`.

```python
my_list = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green"]

print("red" in my_list)
```

{try it}(python3 code/lists/list-in.py 3)

## What happens if you:
* Change the `print` statement to be `print("black" in my_list)`?
* Change the `print` statement to be `print("Red" in my_list)`?
* Change the `print` statement to be `print(my_list in my_list)`?
