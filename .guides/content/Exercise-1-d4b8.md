Complete the code on the left such that the code returns `17`. Please note there are *two* types of errors present in the code:

1) A **compilation error** - the compiler sees a problem and throws an error to alert you

2) A **run-time error** - an error when the code is running.

<details><summary>**Compilation Error Hint**</summary>An example of a compile error would be `int number = "this is not an int";`</details>

<details><summary>**Run-Time Error Hint**</summary>Once you fix the compilation error, you will see the code output does not match what the exercise asks for.</details>

<details><summary>**Try Debugging**</summary>Debugging is a set of practices used to remove bugs. One way is to print out useful information. Try printing out what the variables *should* be to get to 17: $a = 17 - \frac{b-8/2}{3}$ <br> $b = 17 - a * 3 + \frac{8}{2}$</details>
