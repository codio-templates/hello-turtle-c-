## Lists Exercise 5

**Problem**
Write a program that takes a list called `numbers` that has an even length. Your program should should insert an `'*'` between each element of the list. Then print the modified list.

**Expected Output**
* If `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]` then you will print:
`[1, '*', 2, '*', 3, '*', 4]`
* If `numbers = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` then you will print:
`[0, '*', 0, '*', 0, '*', 0, '*', 0, '*', 0]`

**Important**
Do not submit your code to be graded with the variable `numbers`. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you.
