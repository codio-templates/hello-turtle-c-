* ### Recognize the symbols for arithmetic operators
* ### Describe what happens when the `+` and `*` operators are used with strings
* ### Know how to increment and decrement a variable
* ### Understand the order of operations

## Assumptions
* Students are comfortable with declaring variables and using the `print` statement.
* The only real explanation of the operation itself will be for modulo. Students are assumed to be familiar with the rest of these operators.

## Limitations
* The usefulness of modulo is not demonstrated as conditionals have not yet been introduced.
* `pow(a,b)` and `sqrt(a)` are not introduced so that students don't have to worry about importing and using libraries.
