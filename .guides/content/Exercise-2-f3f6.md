Write a program that:
 1. Declares an `int` variable called `my_int`.
 1. Initializes it to the value of `first_num`.
 1. Prints the value of `my_int`.
 1. Re-assigns it to the value of `second_num`.
 1. Prints the value of `my_int`.
 1. Re-assigns it to the value of `third_num`
 1. Prints the value of `my_int`.
 
To test your code, first `COMPILE` it and then check the output of a few different test cases below:

{Compile}(g++ code/fundamentals/exercise2.cpp -o code/fundamentals/exercise2)
{Test with twos}(sh code/fundamentals/exercise2.sh 2 4 6)
{Test with threes}(sh code/fundamentals/exercise2.sh 3 6 9)

{Check It!|assessment}(code-output-compare-2547360760)
