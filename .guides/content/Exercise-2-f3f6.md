Write a program that:
 1. Declares an int variable called `my_int`
 1. Initializes it to the value of `first_num`
 1. Prints the value of `my_int`.
 1. Re-assigns it to the value of `second_num`
 1. Prints the value of `my_int`.
 1. Re-assigns it to the value of `third_num`
 1. Prints the value of `my_int`.
 
To test the code, first compile and then check the output of a few different test cases:

{Compile}(javac code/fundamentals/Exercise2.java)
{Test with twos}(java -cp code/fundamentals/ Exercise2 2 4 6 )
{Test with threes}(java -cp code/fundamentals/ Exercise2 3 6 9 )
