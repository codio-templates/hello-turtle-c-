## Print Ten Times

Write a program that takes in a string `x` from the user as an argument and then prints that information **ten** times using a loop.

### Requirements
* You must include a `for` or `while` loop in your code.
* You must include **one and only one** `cout` and `endl` statement in your code.
* For example, your output should look like this:
```c++
10
10
10
10
10
10
10
10
10
10
```
instead of this:
```c++
10101010101010101010
```

### Compile and test your code with a few different values

{Compile and test with "10"}(sh .guides/loops/exercise2.sh 10)
{Compile and test with "hello"}(sh .guides/loops/exercise2.sh hello)
{Compile and test with "C++"}(sh .guides/loops/exercise2.sh C++)
